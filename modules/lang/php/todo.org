#+TITLE: TODO

* Figure out if we want to encourage the usage of phar.io's phive
https://phar.io/
https://akrabat.com/using-phive-to-manage-phpunit/

Phive has two advantages
- Phar files are run in a sandboxed environment
- Good security: releases are signed

** Add a package for phive

*** Show a message when phive's dependencies need to be updated

* Static Code Analyzers

Emphasize docker usage

** Psalm

https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/5nsmcg/psalm_a_static_analysis_tool_for_php/

** Phan

*** https://github.com/emacs-php/phan.el

Seems to only add font locking for log files

*** https://github.com/TysonAndre/lsp-phan

Not necessary for now.

We could use the following snippet to set the working dir

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

  ;; `phpactor-get-working-dir' throws stringp errors if not in a project.
  (defun +php*project-root (&rest _)
    (setq phpactor-working-dir
          (or phpactor-working-dir
              (php-project-get-root-dir)
              (doom-project-root))))
  (advice-add #'phpactor-get-working-dir :before #'+php*project-root)

#+END_SRC


* More tooling

https://mlocati.github.io/php-cs-fixer-configurator/#fixer:return_type_declaration

* phpactor

** Setup Eldoc
** Setup and improve company
** Better keybindings
** Configurations
** Hydra or frogmenu for context menu?
